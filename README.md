# ROC-Curve-and-Naive-Model-Visualization

## ROC Curve Analysis 

### What the project does

This project provides a set of Python scripts for generating Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curves and analyzing classification model performance. The toolkit includes three distinct scripts:

1. **Threshold-based ROC Curve:**
   - Utilizes a given threshold value to create a confusion matrix, calculate True Positive Rate (TPR) and False Positive Rate (FPR), and plot the ROC curve.
   - The primary purpose is to visualize the performance of a binary classifier based on different threshold values.

2. **Decision Tree Classifier ROC Curve:**
   - Demonstrates how to use a Decision Tree classifier for binary classification.
   - Splits the dataset into training and testing sets, fits a Decision Tree model, predicts probabilities, calculates ROC curve, and plots the results.
   - Useful for understanding the performance of a Decision Tree model in a binary classification scenario.

3. **Naive Bayes and K-Nearest Neighbors Classifier Evaluation:**
   - Compares the performance of Naive Bayes and K-Nearest Neighbors classifiers on a given dataset.
   - Outputs accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report for both classifiers.
   - Useful for assessing and contrasting the performance of different classifiers.

### Why the project is useful

- **Threshold-based ROC Curve:**
  - Helpful for understanding how different threshold values impact the performance of a binary classifier.
  - Aids in selecting an optimal threshold for a specific use case.

- **Decision Tree Classifier ROC Curve:**
  - Illustrates the ROC curve for a Decision Tree classifier, allowing users to evaluate its binary classification performance.
  - Useful for assessing the model's ability to discriminate between classes.

- **Naive Bayes and K-Nearest Neighbors Classifier Evaluation:**
  - Provides a comparative analysis of two popular classification algorithms.
  - Helps users assess the strengths and weaknesses of Naive Bayes and K-Nearest Neighbors classifiers on a given dataset.
